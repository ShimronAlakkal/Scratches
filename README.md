# Scratches
This repo contains some of the simple time-pass projects or scripts that I'll be doing.

For projects based on python and mysql to work, you'll need to perform the following in your terminal
 For Windows
 
 ```bash
 
cd <project dir>

py -m venv <env Name>

./<env Name>/Scripts/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

for mac

```bash
cd <project folder>

python3 -m venv <env name>

source env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
