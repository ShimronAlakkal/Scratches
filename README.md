# Scratches
This repo contains some of the simple time-pass projects or scripts that I'll be doing.

For projects based on python and mysql to work, you'll need to perform the following in your terminal
 For Windows
 ```
cd <project dir>
py -m venv <env Name>
.\<env Name>\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
